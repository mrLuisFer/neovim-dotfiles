## ‚ö° About

This is my personal config and adapted to my needs, but it can be easily adapted to any config, as well as separate vim files

This will be adapted for **Windows** and **Linux** systems
And they will correct things in the future

### üå± Contribute

You can contribute by making a **pull request** with any _fix_ or _feature_ that you want to add :D

If you don't have an idea, you can follow these steps:

- Fork the project (optional in case you have a permission error)
  Or clone it on your local machine

- Create a new branch with:

  ```bash
  $ git checkout -b <new branch>
  ```

- When you have all the changes you have:

  ```bash
  $ git add .
  ```

  ```bash
  $ git commit -m "a description"
  ```

  ```bash
  $ git push origin <new branch>
  ```

And do a **pull request** to the **main** branch

### üì¶ Requirements

- **Vim-Plug**

- **Git**

- [**RipGrep**](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

- **Neovim** C:

## üî• Important

For a good operation of this configuration and to take **advantage of all** the Plugins, we recommend you to use **version 0.5 or higher
** that adds many improvements and support for many things

More information below:
[Official Documentation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
[Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases)

## ü¶Ñ Usage
When cloning the repository, in case the folder is named *neovim-dotfiles*, change the name to **nvim** so that Neovim recognizes it

### üìö Install Neovim:
  For **Windows** run one of the two commands within **powershell**, you can use **choco** or **scoop**
  ```
  $ scoop install neovim
  
  # Or

  $ choco install neovim -y
  ```
  
  And for **Linux** and **MacOs** : [neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
  
### üåô Install Manager:
  In this config use vim plug to handle and install plugins

  To install **Vim Plug** you can run any of these commands

  Linux, Unix
  ```bash
    sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
  ```
  
  Linux (Flatpak)
  ```bash
  curl -fLo ~/.var/app/io.neovim.nvim/data/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
  ```
  
  Windows (Powershell)
  ```bash
  iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim |`
    ni "$(@($env:XDG_DATA_HOME, $env:LOCALAPPDATA)[$null -eq $env:XDG_DATA_HOME])/nvim-data/site/autoload/plug.vim" -Force
  ```
  
  More information about vim plug:
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  - [Tutorial](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tutorial)
  - [Requirements](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/requirements)
  
### üìò Setup Windows:
  ```
  $ cd %APPDATA\Local\nvim
  ```
  
  If you don't have **the nvim folder** do this: (if you have it, ignore this step)
  ```bash
  $ mkdir nvim
  
  $ cd nvim
  ```
  
  ```bash
  $ git clone -b main https://github.com/mrLuisFer/neovim-dotfiles.git .
  
  # echo "Cloned the configuration :D"
  ```


### üêß Setup Linux:
  ```
  $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nvim
  
  $ cd $HOME/.config/nvim
 
  $ git clone -b main https://github.com/mrLuisFer/neovim-dotfiles.git .
  
  # echo "Cloned the configuration :D"
  ```

### üçé Setup MacOs:
  ```
  $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nvim
  
  $ cd $HOME/.config/nvim
  
  $ git clone -b main https://github.com/mrLuisFer/neovim-dotfiles.git .
  
  # "Cloned the configuration :D"
  ```

### üåà Colorschemes
If you do not like the color that comes by default, you can execute the command inside **neovim:** `:colorscheme + TAB` and you will see a list of themes that you can select

When you find one you like, go to `init.vim` and search with *neovim* `/colorscheme` and write down the name of the **theme** you want to use.

## üêä CoC Extensions
[Whats Coc?](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

If you want to **install** or **add** an extension for **Coc** you can check the following page and without modifying anything unless necessary, just **run the command** and it will be ready to use

Install extensions like:

```
:CocInstall coc-json coc-tsserver
```
[You can find more extensions here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions)

## ‚ö† Warning

It may be that when you enter the cloned configuration in nvim for the first time, you will get multiple errors

But don't worry just press `Enter` and run this command **:PlugInstall**
Several plugins will be downloaded, then **exit and enter neovim again**


## üêô Change Repository

If you want to change the repository using this config, but with your own configurations and / or adapt to your needs

Another way is by changing the **git-remote**, following these steps:

- To see the list of remotes that are in the repository
```sh
$ git remote -v
```

- To remove that remote, run:
```sh
$ git remote remove origin
```

- And add the new remote from your repository
```sh
$ git remote add origin <url del repo>
```

## üìî Vim Dashboard
![vim Dashboard](./doc/dashboard.png)

If you want neovim to show you a dashboard screen similar to this one, you need certain things

The most important is that you need [Neovim 0.5 or higher](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)

You also need **[Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)**, this is for the operation of search engines for files, words, history, etc.

- [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

You also need to have **[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** installed, this is already included in the configuration but if it shows you an error you can read the documentation

- [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzfv)

An alternative that you can use is **[Vim Clap](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/)**, it also comes inside the config but you can check its documentation

- [liuchengxu/vim-clap](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/)

And obviously you can check out the original repository from **vim dashboard creator**

- [glepnir/dashboard-nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/dashboard-nvim)

* Note that the minimum supported version of Rust for ripgrep is **1.34.0**,
  although ripgrep may work with older versions.
* Note that the binary may be bigger than expected because it contains debug
  symbols. This is intentional. To remove debug symbols and therefore reduce
  the file size, run `strip` on the binary.

```sh
$ cargo install ripgrep
```

If your **OS doesn't appear**, you can search the official repository
