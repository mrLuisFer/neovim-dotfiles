## üìó mrLuisFer's - Neovim Config

An explanation of how to use this config in Windows is in [this video - Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw1Ipy5_P1OL0zUJMfYC7-A)

## ‚ö° About

This is my personal config and adapted to my needs, but it can be easily adapted to any config, as well as separate vim files

This will be adapted for **Windows** and **Linux** systems
And they will correct things in the future

### üåà Colorschemes
If you do not like the color that comes by default, you can execute the command inside **neovim:** `colorscheme + TAB` and you will see a list of themes that you can select

When you find one you like, go to `init.vim` and search with *neovim* `/colorscheme` and write down the name of the **theme** you want to use.
